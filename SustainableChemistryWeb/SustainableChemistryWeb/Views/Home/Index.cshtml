        <p>
            The Sustainable Chemistry Expert Framework is designed to provide synthetic chemical reaction information that may be used to synthesize the chemical compound under
            evaluation. These chemical reactions are based upon traditional organic chemistry named reactions that are used to produce a specific class of chemical based upon the
            related functional group present in the chemical. Upon placing each of the individual chemical reactions into a series, the desired chemical can be synthesized. In
            addition, the reactants from each individual reaction form a chemical lineage which can be used to determine the parent compounds required to manufacture the desired
            compound. This chemical's lineage can then be used to identify all the reactants, reagents and conditions involved in the manufacturing phase and contribute to the
            evaluation of the chemical's life cycle.
