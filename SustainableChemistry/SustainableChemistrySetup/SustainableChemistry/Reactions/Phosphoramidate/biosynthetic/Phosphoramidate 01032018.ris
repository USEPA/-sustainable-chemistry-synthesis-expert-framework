T1  - Design, synthesis and activity of bisubstrate, transition-state analogues and competitive inhibitors of aspartate transcarbamylase.
N2  - Aspartate transcarbamylase initiates the de novo biosynthetic pathway for the prodn. of the pyrimidine nucleotides, precursors of nucleic acids.  This pathway is particularly active in rapidly growing cells and tissues.  Thus, this enzyme has been tested as a potential target for antiproliferative drugs.  In the present work, on the basis of its structural and mechanistic properties, a series of substrate analogs, including potential suicide-pseudosubstrates was synthesized and their putative inhibitory effects were tested using E. coli aspartate transcarbamylase as a model.  Two of these compds. appear to be very efficient inhibitors of this enzyme. [on SciFinder(R)]

T1  - Iodoform, a New Reagent in the Todd-Atherton Reaction.
N2  - An innovative and convenient application of iodoform as the reagent in the synthesis of phosphoramidates via Todd-Atherton reaction is described.  The full stereoselectivity of this transformation using a 4-methyl-1,3,2-dioxaphosphorinane model system was demonstrated. [on SciFinder(R)]

T1  - One-step transformation of ammonium dialkyl phosphoroselenoates into dialkyl phosphoramidates.
N2  - Ammonium dialkyl phosphoroselenoates are directly converted into the dialkyl phosphoramidates by iodosobenzene and iodoxybenzene.  The inversion of configuration at the phosphorus atom, using model diastereoisomeric ammonium cis- and trans-2-oxo-2-seleno-4-methyl-1,3,2-dioxaphosphinan system, was obsd.  The mechanistic scheme of this transformation is discussed. [on SciFinder(R)]
