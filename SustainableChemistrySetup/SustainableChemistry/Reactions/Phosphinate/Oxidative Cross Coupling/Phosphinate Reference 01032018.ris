If 1.1 equiv of the T3P reagent is used, the esterifications are fast and efficient at 25°.  In the case of more reactive models it was enough to apply 0.66 equiv of T3P at 85° under microwave conditions.  The amidation of 1-hydroxy-3-methyl-3-phospholene oxide could also be accomplished under similar conditions. [on SciFinder(R)]

T1  - A Copper-Catalyzed Variant of the Michaelis-Arbuzov Reaction.
N2  - As part of our studies on copper-catalyzed arylation of nucleophiles, authors report on Michaelis-Arbuzov reactions with a novel catalytic system, featuring a copper(I) salt as precatalyst without any addnl. ligand.  This procedure is an interesting alternative to the use of expensive and toxic transition metals (nickel, palladium) traditionally used as catalysts in Michaelis-Arbuzov reactions.  The approach allows the synthesis from tri-Et phosphite, di-Et aryl phosphonite, and diaryl ethylphosphinite of various aryl phosphonates, aryl phosphinates, and aryl phosphine oxides, resp.  These families of compds. are essential owing to their resp. importance in bioorg. and medical chem., their applicability as flame retardants, and their usability in coordination chem. and catalysis.

T1  - A versatile and efficient ligand for copper-catalyzed formation of C-N, C-O, and P-C bonds: pyrrolidine-2-phosphonic acid phenyl monoester.
N2  - A new and readily available bidentate N,O-anionic ligand, pyrrolidine-2-phosphonic acid Ph monoester (PPAPM) was prepd. by phosphonylation of pyrroline trimer and tested in copper-catalyzed cross-coupling of aryl halides with amines, phenols and hydrophosphonates, providing high yields of arom. amines, phenol ethers and arylphosphonates, resp.  Reaction of the pyrroline trimer, dodecahydrotripyrrolo[1,2-a:1',2'-c:1'',2''-e][1,3,5]triazine, with HP(O)(OPh)2 with subsequent partial hydrolysis gave Ph hydrogen 2-pyrrolidinephosphonate monoester (PPAPM).  Coupling of ArX with primary and secondary amines HNR1R2 catalyzed by CuI/PPAPM gave arom. amines ArNR1R2 (3a-y; Ar = Ph, 4-MeOC6H4, 3-NO2C6H4, 4-BrC6H4; X = Br, I; R1 = Me, H; R2 Cy, Ph, 2-NO2C6H4, 3-NO2C6H4, 2,6-Me2C6H3, 4-MeCOC6H4, MeCO; NR1R2 = morpholino) with 71-98% yields.  Coupling of ArX with HOR3 gave arom. ethers ArOR3 (R3 = Ph, 2-NO2C6H4, 2-naphthyl, 9-fluorenylmethyl, phenethyl, C16H33) with up to 98% yields.  Hydrophosphonates HP(O)(OR4)2 (R4 = iPr, Et), phosphinate PhP(H)(O)(OEt) and hypophosphites gave the corresponding arylphosphonates and diarylphosphinates.  Addn. of the PPAPM ligand greatly increases the reactivity of the copper catalyst, and the resulting versatile and efficient catalyst system is of widespread and practical application in cross-coupling reactions.

T1  - Oxidative desulfurization at pentacovalent phosphorus by photogenerated radicals.
N2  - Acylphosphine oxides undergo photochem. Norrish type 1 cleavage process to give radicals which oxidatively desulfurize organophosphine sulfides to give the corresponding oxides.  Thus, treatment of photoinitiators, RC(O)P(O)R12 (R = Ph, R1 = Me, Et; R = 2,4,6-Me3C6H2, 2,6-Me2C6H3, R1 = Ph), with Ph3PS, Ph2P(S)OEt, PhP(S)(OEt)2, and (EtO)3PS in MeCN in the presence of O gave the corresponding phosphine oxides.  The irradn. time for these reaction was 10 h. [on SciFinder(R)]
