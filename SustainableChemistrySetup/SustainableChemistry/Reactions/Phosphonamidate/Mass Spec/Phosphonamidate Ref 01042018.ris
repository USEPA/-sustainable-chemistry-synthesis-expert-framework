T1  - Mass spectrometric study on O(S)-alkyl N,N-dimethylamino alkylphosphonates (alkylphosphonothiolates) for Chemical Weapons Convention verification purposes.
N2  - Modified microsynthesis of O(S)-alkyl N,N-dimethylamino alkylphosphonates (alkylphosphonothiolates) which are included in schedule 2 of Chem. Weapons Convention (CWC) annex of chems., is reported.  Retention indexes and electron ionization mass spectral data with fragmentation routes for these chems. are also given.  Mass spectrometric studies revealed that their fragmentations were dominated by alkene elimination, McLafferty rearrangement, Î±-cleavage, amine elimination, etc.  Conclusions were confirmed using MS/MS expts., fragment ions of deuterated analogs and d. functional theory calcns.
